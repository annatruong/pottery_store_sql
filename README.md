# Pottery Store SQL Database (Foundation Project)

A SQLite database for a pottery store, designed to demonstrate foundational SQL skills.

This project was completed as part of my SQL training and demonstrates my ability to:

- Design a relational database schema
- Create tables using SQL
- Seed data into the database
- Write SQL queries to answer analytical questions
